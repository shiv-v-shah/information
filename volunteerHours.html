		<h3>BAPS Mahamandir (Temple) Construction(Robbinsville Township, NJ)(Full time/Overtime 16 July 2022 - 19 August 2022, 217 hours)</h3>
		<div>I spent 5 weeks as a construction volunteer for the temple. I volunteered with stone prep and stone placeing. Stones would get delivered to us and we would organize them, cut them to the given size, drill holes as nececarry, and wash them. Afterwards they would be loaded on the crane. On the top, I helped with preparing rebar, pouring cement, placing stones, and filling the gaps with a limestone adhesive. </div>
		<div>//FIXME more information can be helpful here. I can add information about my observations. This should be complete by the end of 2022</div>

		<h3>BAPS Swaminarayan Temple(of Milpitas California)(childhood-10 July 2022)(136 hours as tabla teacher, 67 hours for Bal Sabha (childrens services))</h3>
		<div>I have been going to the Baps Swaminarayan Temple every sunday since Childhood. I have been giving back to the community by volunteering. As a child I have volunteered with many small things like packing boxes of sweets for our annual Diwali exhibition. Going to the temple has shaped my life by giving me a connection to Hinduism, and teaching me how to live a happy life. I feel that it is my responsibility to give back to the temple that has given so much to me, and to teach Hinduism to younger kids to give them a connection to their identy despite not living in India. Once I got to high school, on top of tasks to keep the temple running, I started teaching Gujrati(language) and Tabla(instrument) to the younger kids. During the global pandemic, I became the only teacher for the first level tabla class. I had to expiriment with various teaching styles and see what would work best for the students. Teaching Tabla/Gujrati would take 2 hours a week for 30 weeks every year. I had also presented in sabha(sunday services/assembly) and special events various times. I have participated in singing/playing tabla, doing speeches, as well as skits and dances. </p></div>
		<div>In August 2021, I was invited by 2 of my good friends to present in Bal Sabha(sunday services, for kids 1st - 3rd grade) for the first time. I had to present two very short stories. I had 20 minutes to present the simple stories in an engaging way to kids. I would add details, and draw along on the whiteboard. The hard part about teaching the young kids is that they are not afraid to ask questions, and they can easily start fooling around. A 20 minute presentation turned into a 40 minute presentation. Since my first presentation went well, I decided to stay. BAPS provides a curriculum with weekly lesson plans, however, there are/were 100 BAPS temples over north america that are all unique, and we had to interpret the lesson plan to suit our temple. In our group, it was a challenge to get the young kids to listen to us. The way we worked around this was to always have a sport for the activity, so the kids donâ€™t have the energy to fool around once it is time for the presentation. We also had to adapt the presentations to our kids. One Sunday, the curriculum included many stories from the Mahabharat. However, I know that our kids can not remember more than two stories from one Sunday, so I just took two of those stories, and presented them with added details and clips from the TV show. One Sunday, I did an off curriculum presentation about social media usage, since I believed that our kids should be aware of the good and bad usages of social media even before they start needing it.</p></div>
		<div>At our temple, Diwali is the biggest festival. Diwali is the one Hindu festival that many of the non Hindu people in the community know about. Because of this, we have a massive amount of people visiting our temple. We have a big exibition in our temple, a very big Ankut (offering of food and sweets to God), and food stalls. To set up the event people come to the temple during the weekdays to help out. The Friday or Saturday before, We stay up almost the whole night to set up the exibition. As kids, we would help the older people with various small tasks. As kids, we enjoyed packing the sweets for distributing with the old grandparents. As high school kids, we are tasked with setting up the Ankut in front of the Murtis(divine image) of God. In 12th grade, I helped out with the college diwali exhibition at UC Berkley. I learned how to explain the core aspects of Diwali to random people as a part of the exibition</p></div>
		
		<h3>Cupertino High School Environmental Club and Sillicon Valley Youth Climate Action(2018-2022)(350 hours at SVYCA)</h3>

		<h4>9th grade</h4>
		<div>In 9th grade, I joined the Environmental Club at Cupertino High School because of my love for nature. I expected it to be a club where I just hangout with similar minded people and learn about the earth. Emily who was the president back then did quite a lot to improve the school. We distributed recycle bin covers to various teachers. One of our goals of the club is to implement composting at our school. That is a very difficult goal because our facilities director is against it. Without his permission. We managed one compost bin in the kitchen. At the end of the school year, Emily wanted to start taking action at the city level. Over the summer(of 2019), we started meeting every Tuesday at the Library to discuss how we can take action at the city. Students from various other high schools including Monta Vista, Homestead, Archbishop Mitty, and Harker joined our team. Since we now had students outside Cupertino High School, We became the Cupertino Youth Climate Action Team. In July, Our team members went to a youth climate summit at DeAnza College. Many people from various cities throughout Silicon Valley Came to the summit. We all met with other youth from our city and made plans to take action in our city. Many other teams similar to ours were formed. We all united to create the parent organization, Silicon Valley Youth Climate Action. In August, our hard work payid off. We were assigned a 10 minute presentation at the city council meeting. We presented proposals for all electric reach codes, fossil fuel divestment, Natural gas Phase Out, and Plastic Reduction. The City Council immediately ageed with the all electric reach codes part of it. Making us successful. </p></div>
